# movie-recommendation-using-neural-network

Content-based movie recommendation using neural networks is a technique used to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and the attributes of the movies they have liked in the past. This approach relies on creating a representation of each movie as a set of features or attributes such as genre, director, actors, and plot keywords.

Neural networks are used to learn the patterns and relationships between these features and the user's preferences, by training on a dataset of movies and user ratings. The neural network model then predicts the rating a user would give to a new movie, based on the similarity between the attributes of the new movie and the user's preferred attributes.

The content-based approach is useful for providing personalized recommendations to users based on their historical behavior and preferences, but it has limitations in recommending new and unknown movies that do not have a similar set of attributes to previously liked movies. Additionally, this approach does not take into account the social aspect of movie recommendations, such as popular or trending movies.
